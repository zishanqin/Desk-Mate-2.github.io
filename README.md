# Desk-Mate
Desk Mate creates a virtual atmosphere of libraries, study rooms, workspaces and discussion corners for user to choose. The purpose of desk mate is to improve the user experience of working from home by forming a virtual atmosphere that the user used to and like to work in (for instance , quiet library with everyone around work hard , comfy discussion desk that friends can discuss while study). Result of experiments shows that atmosphere plays a vital role of productivity enhancement and we wish user can get benefit from the virtual atmosphere during quarantine and still live their life happily.
